# Notes

Asynchronous JS challenge to build a simple front-end app. 

The current state of the codebase is why it's so important to complete a proper domain model and keep a continuous understanding of my own projects.
If repeating this challenge became important I would look to keeping better records and storing them both locally and on Gitbook, so that I might be able to revisit projects with greater ease.
